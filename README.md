# Multi-threaded Dictionary Server
 
## Task & Requirements

Using a client-server architecture, design and implement a multi-threaded server that allows concurrent clients to search the meaning(s) of a word, add a new word, and remove an existing word.

This assignment has been designed to demonstrate the use of two fundamental technologies that have been discussed during the lectures:\
• **Sockets**\
• **Threads**

Hence, the assignment must make an EXPLICIT use of the two above. By explicit, we mean that in your application, sockets and threads must be the lowest level of abstraction for network communication and concurrency.

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is required for this project.
